# Detailed Report on Processors  ISRO

## Most common Architectures :- 
CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):

1. CISC architectures have a large set of instructions, some of which can perform complex operations.
- Instructions vary in length and complexity.
- Examples: x86 (Intel, AMD), Motorola 68k.

2. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):
- RISC architectures have a smaller set of simple and frequently used instructions.
- Instructions are typically of fixed length.
- Emphasizes a smaller set of instructions with higher execution speed.
- Examples: ARM, MIPS, PowerPC.

3. EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing):
- EPIC architectures focus on parallel processing and execution.
- Example: Intel Itanium.

4. VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word):
- Similar to EPIC, VLIW architectures use long instruction words to represent parallel operations.
- The compiler schedules the instructions for parallel execution.
- Examples: TI C6x, IA-64.

5. Superscalar:
- Superscalar architectures execute multiple instructions simultaneously.
- Multiple execution units are used to achieve parallelism.
- Instructions are dynamically scheduled for execution.
- Examples: Intel Pentium, AMD Athlon.

6. Vector Processors:
- Vector processors operate on vectors or arrays of data with a single instruction.
- Suited for tasks involving repetitive and parallelizable operations.
- Examples: Cray supercomputers, NEC SX series.

7. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):
- SIMD architectures process multiple data elements in parallel using a single instruction.
- Well-suited for parallelizable tasks like multimedia processing.
- Examples: Intel SSE/AVX, ARM NEON.

8. MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data):
- MIMD architectures have multiple independent processors that can execute different instructions simultaneously.
- Suited for parallel processing and multitasking.
- Examples: Multi-core processors, clusters, distributed computing systems.

9. Distributed Processors:
- Distributed processors consist of multiple processors working together over a network.
- Each processor may have its own memory and execute its own set of instructions.
- Examples: Beowulf clusters, modern cloud computing infrastructures.

10. Neuromorphic Processors:
- Neuromorphic processors are designed to mimic the structure and functionality of the human brain.
- They are optimized for tasks related to artificial intelligence and neural networks.
- Examples: IBM TrueNorth, SpiNNaker.
